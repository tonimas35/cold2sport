 * game-server. The discriminated `type` field gives the dispatcher an
 * exhaustive switch — adding an event to `ClientToServerEvents` and
 * missing a dispatcher arm becomes a TS error.
 *
 * `payload` is parsed from the JSON column on the stream entry and cast
 * to `PayloadOf<E>`. We do NOT re-validate at the consumer because the
 * trust boundary (ws-gateway middleware) already ran the Zod schema;
 * the stream is internal traffic.
 *
 * `gameSlug` is the namespace the socket connected through. The stream
 * itself is per-slug already, so this field is redundant for routing,
 * but it lets handlers read the slug without re-deriving from socket
 * data and makes the envelope self-describing on the wire.
