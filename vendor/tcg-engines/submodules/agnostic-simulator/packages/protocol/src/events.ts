/**

 * compile time.
 *
 * Per-event payloads come from `./schemas.ts` (client→server, derived via
 * `z.infer`) and `./payloads.ts` (server→client, plain interfaces). Adding
 * a new event = adding a payload + a one-line entry here; the inbox
 * dispatcher's `switch` becomes non-exhaustive and TS forces the update.
