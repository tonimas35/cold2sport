## Log audit (aggregated by category)

No log findings. Either the logs are clean or the audit needs new rules.

## Rules-invariant violations

None (64 games audited).

## Non-natural terminations

None — every game ended by the rules.

## Hidden-information leakage (per-seat projections)

None (64 games, 3022 hidden names checked against both seat projections).

## Prompt coverage (point-and-click surface exercised)
